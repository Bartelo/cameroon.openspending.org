<h2 class="page-header">About Cameroon's Spending</h2>

<div class="row">

<div class="span8 offset4">

<p>Deliberations around public budgets can sometimes bring out the worst in parliamentarians but impassioned responses rarely come from citizens themselves. Perhaps it is because budgets come in the form of tomes, with tables upon tables of data and very little context. Even though those tables reflect social services and entitlements that impact us all, simply disclosing this information does not necessarily mean that these documents will be understood or the resources well spent.</p>

<p>The Budget Transparency Initiative (BTI), led by the World Bank’s Social Development Department and funded by the Governance Partnership Facility, has introduced a methodology to disclose, simplify, and analyze budgets at various levels to not only bring this information closer to citizens but also create enabling spaces for them to provide feedback.</p>

<p>An ongoing impetus for decentralization in Cameroon has resulted in an increase in fiscal transfers to local councils, making budget transparency at the local level even more critical.</p>

<p>Under the stewardship of Regional governors and high-level regional steering committees, a process to disclose the budgets of 60 schools, 25 health centers and 12 local councils was initiated. The Governors and steering committee members themselves, with support from two NGOs (Integrity Network Cameroon and SNV – Cameroon), led the process to mobilize communities for the budget dissemination meetings. Traditional and religious authorities and the use of local languages were also crucial in engaging local communities. Radio programs, theatre performances and other forms of educational entertainment in local languages were used to deliver the message of the importance of budgets and budget transparency. Simplified <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTGOVACC/Resources/BudgetTransparencyIndexforLocalCouncilscopy.pdf">local council budget templates</a> and a <a href="bti.html">Local Council Budget Transparency Index</a> were also developed to encourage local councils in exchanging best practices in budget transparency.  <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTGOVACC/Resources/SecondarySchoolBudgetTemplatecopy.pdf">School and health center budget templates</a> were created, populated with data, distributed during dissemination meetings and also posted on visible places in the community.</p>

<p>In the Cameroon context, this combination of high-level political will, trusted local leaders and community radio has engaged and informed citizens of their local budgets.  In several instances, a platform for people to directly pose questions to authorities regarding services and expenditures generated constructive discussions.</p>
